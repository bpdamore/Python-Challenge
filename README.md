# Python-Challenge
A place to store my python scripts


## PyBank

In this challenge, I've been given a CSV containing a few years' worth of financial data from a company. 

The csv has two columns: `Date`, and `Profit/Losses`

I was to create a printout, both in the terminal and in a txt file, containing the following:

- Total Months
- Total Profit/Loss
- Average Change
- Greatest Increase in Profits: `Date` and `Value`
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: `Date` and `Value`




## PyPoll

In this challenge, I've been given a CSV containing a bunch of polling data. 

The csv has three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`

I was to create a printout, both in the terminal and in a txt file, containing the following:

- The total number of votes
- The candidates, the percent of votes they won, and the number of votes they won
- The winner of the election
